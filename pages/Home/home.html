                In 1998, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros.
            for a reported £1 million ($1,982,900). Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept 
            strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the late Richard
            Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and 
            the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[179] After many directors
            including Steven Spielberg, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, and Alan Parker were considered, Chris 
            Columbus was appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 
            (titled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States), with Warner Bros. citing his
            work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and proven experience with directing
            children as influences for their decision.
            After extensive casting, filming began in October 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London itself,
            with production ending in July 2001. Philosopher's Stone was released on 14 November 2001.
            Just three days after the film's release, production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 
            also directed by Columbus, began. Filming was completed in summer 2002, with the film being released 
            on 15 November 2002. Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Harry Potter, doing so for all succeeding films 
            in the franchise.
            Columbus declined to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, only acting as producer.
            Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón took over the job, and after shooting in 2003, the film was released
            on 4 June 2004. Due to the fourth film beginning its production before the third's release, Mike
            Newell was chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, released on 18 November 2005.
            Newell became the first British director of the series, with television director David Yates following 
            suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Production began in January 
            2006 and the film was released the following year in July 2007.[185] After executives were "really delighted" 
            with his work on the film, Yates was selected to direct Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which was released
            on 15 July 2009.
            In March 2008, Warner Bros. President and COO Alan F. Horn announced that the final instalment in the series,
            Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, would be released in two cinematic parts: Part 1 on 19 November 2010 and 
            Part 2 on 15 July 2011. Production of both parts started in February 2009, with the final day of principal photography 
            taking place on 12 June 2010.
            Rowling had creative control on the film series, observing the filmmaking process of Philosopher's Stone and serving as 
            producer on the two-part Deathly Hallows, alongside David Heyman and David Barron. The Harry Potter films have 
            been top-rank box office hits, with all eight releases on the list of highest-grossing films worldwide. Philosopher's 
            Stone was the highest-grossing Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series, Deathly 
            Hallows Part 2, while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least. As well as being a financial success, the film series 
            has also been a success among film critics.
            Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans, with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the 
            first two films, and another group preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.
            Rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her "favourite one" in the series.
            She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, "It is simply impossible to incorporate every one 
            of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions novels do not have,
            constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my 
            readers' imaginations".
            At the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, Rowling was joined by producers David Heyman and David Barron 
            along with directors David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell in collecting the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding 
            British Contribution to Cinema on behalf of all the films in the series. Actors Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who play 
            main characters Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, were also in attendance.
